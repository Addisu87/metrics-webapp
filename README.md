# metrics-webapp

> This react capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numerical values). It is created using React and Redux. I have used an external API to show a covid-19 statistical data of specific continent and country. This webapp has a home page to show a filtered items of continent and a countries page to show a details data of specific country.
