# metrics-webapp

> This metrics web app is built as a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numerical values). It is created using React and Redux. I have used an external API to show a covid-19 statistical data of specific continents and countries. This web app has a home page to show filtered items of continents and a countries page to show details data of a particular country.
